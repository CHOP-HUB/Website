  Technological systems are the focal points of our daily lives — but they are mostly built elsewhere, owned by someone else, and optimized for profit. As a result, we learn to adapt ourselves to systems we didn’t choose. We learn to consume, not to contribute.
</p>
<p>
  But what if we treated these technologies not as black boxes, but as playgrounds with endless possibilities that we can explore together?
</p>
<p>
  In a world increasingly shaped by extraction, surveillance, and dependence, we need new patterns of participation. Not only for climate resilience or economic justice — but to remember what it means to consume a resource. It’s a call to shift from passive consumption to active participation — as a way to reconnect with the people, tools and infrastuctures that surround us.

    <p>The goal is neither to return to the past, nor about chasing technological spectacle. </p>
    <p>This website runs on a solar server located in a community garden in Barcelona. It’s small, local, and energy-aware — the site itself is part of the experiment.</p>

  As of now, the chop operates on a GitHub Organization that hosts files and instructions for the different projects where they can be copied, customized and maintained in true open source fashion. After further development, chop aims to provide these features as part of the platform.
</p>
<p>
  This site is a working prototype — like the tools it shares. Over time, chop will grow: more projects, more contributions, more translations. The goal is not a polished product, but a living archive for tangible, shared autonomy.
